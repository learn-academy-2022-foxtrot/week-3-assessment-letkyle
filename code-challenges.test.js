// --------------------1) Create a function that takes in a number (greater than 2) and returns an array that length containing the numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

// create a test starting with describe and the function name "fib" with the information provided and desired output
